# How to run the app

```
run npm dev
```

Visit http://localhost:5173/

# Run tests

```
run npm test
```

# If I had more time I would have:

- store state in search string when returning from detail view.
- Implement more tests and mock their API calls.
- Improve overall like conditional rendering of data fields since some of them are undefined.
- Better names for the labels and buttons.
- Making the page more accessible by adding alt properties.
